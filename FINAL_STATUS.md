# 5/3/1 Tracker - Final Implementation Status

## ✅ All Requirements Implemented

### 1. Fixed Core Lifts
- ✅ **Only 4 core lifts**: Overhead Press, Bench Press, Squat, and Deadlift
- ✅ **No custom lift creation**: Users cannot define additional lifts
- ✅ **Lift data stored in user profile**: All lift data is part of the user model

### 2. Mandatory Initial Setup Form
- ✅ **Weight unit selection**: Radio buttons for Pounds or Kilograms
- ✅ **Rep max inputs**: Input fields for each lift (e.g., "Bench Press → X reps × X Pounds/Kilograms")
- ✅ **Available plates selection**: Checkboxes for 100, 45, 35, 25, 10, 5, 2.5 plates
- ✅ **Mandatory Submit button**: No calculations display until form is submitted
- ✅ **1RM calculation**: Uses Epley formula to calculate real 1RM from rep maxes

### 3. 1 Rep Max Summary Table
- ✅ **Real 1RM display**: Shows calculated 1RM for each lift
- ✅ **Wendler's Training Max**: Shows 90% of 1RM for each lift
- ✅ **Appears above cycles**: Summary table displays before generated cycles
- ✅ **Clean tabular layout**: Professional table design with lift icons

### 4. Generated Cycles Display
- ✅ **All lifts simultaneously**: Shows cycles for all 4 lifts on the same view
- ✅ **Warm-up sets**: 3 sets at 40-60% Training Max, increasing gradually
- ✅ **Main working sets**: Correct 5/3/1 percentages per week with AMRAP on last set
- ✅ **BBB sets**: 5×10 @ 30% Training Max for all lifts
- ✅ **Plate calculations**: Shows exactly which plates are required for each set
- ✅ **Respects available plates**: Only uses plates the user has available

### 5. UI/UX Requirements
- ✅ **Clean tabular layout**: All lifts and cycles visible simultaneously
- ✅ **Mobile-first design**: Responsive design optimized for mobile devices
- ✅ **Dark-mode styling**: Professional dark theme throughout
- ✅ **Touch-friendly**: Large buttons and touch-optimized interface

### 6. Calculation Rules
- ✅ **Training Max based**: All calculations use 90% of 1RM
- ✅ **No weights above Training Max**: Except for AMRAP sets
- ✅ **Automatic warm-ups**: Included in all workout calculations
- ✅ **Automatic BBB sets**: Included for all lifts
- ✅ **Plate calculations**: Shows exact plate requirements for each set

### 7. Technical Implementation
- ✅ **Database schema**: Updated to support fixed lifts and user preferences
- ✅ **GraphQL API**: Updated to match new data structure
- ✅ **5/3/1 calculations**: Enhanced with warm-ups, BBB, and plate calculations
- ✅ **React components**: Modular, reusable components
- ✅ **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout
- ✅ **Materialize CSS**: Consistent styling framework
