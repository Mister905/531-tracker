- **Week 2**: 70%, 80%, 90% of Training Max  
- **Week 3**: 75%, 85%, 95% of Training Max
- **Week 4**: 40%, 50%, 60% of Training Max (Deload)

- **Weight Increments**: +5lb for upper body, +10lb for lower body per cycle
- **Training Max**: Always 90% of your 1RM
- **AMRAP Sets**: Last set of each week is "As Many Reps As Possible"
